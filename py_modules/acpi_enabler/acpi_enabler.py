class AcpiEnabler:
    """Enables Linux Dynamic Kernel Module Support ACPI calls on SteamOS.

    Downloads the linux-neptune kernel modules + headers packages
    matching the currently running kernel and installs them via pacman
    (bracketed by disabling/re-enabling steamos-readonly), then builds
    and registers the actual acpi_call DKMS module — the out-of-tree
    module (https://github.com/nix-community/acpi_call) that exposes
    /proc/acpi/call for raw ACPI method calls from userspace, which is
    the thing this class is actually meant to enable. It isn't in
    Valve's pacman repos, so it's built from source, then registered
    with DKMS and loaded (see install_acpi_call_module()).

    Building acpi_call needs a full C toolchain (gcc, binutils, ...),
    which is a couple hundred MB installed -- too much for SteamOS's
    root partition, which typically only has a small margin of free
    space. Installing it there directly can fail outright with "not
    enough free disk space", and even when it fits, it's wasted
    permanent space for something only needed once, briefly, at build
    time. So the whole toolchain + build instead lives inside a
    disposable overlay backed by a loopback image on /home (which has
    real free space -- game storage), the exact same technique
    common/selfheal/repatch_script.py already uses on-device for the NVIDIA driver
    build, just overlaid on the live root here instead of a mounted
    target partition. Only the resulting tiny build artifacts (the
    compiled module + its dkms bookkeeping) get copied back onto the
    real root; the toolchain itself is discarded with the overlay,
    so "/" never grows by more than a few hundred KB.

    Restructured into a self-contained class (matching NvidiaUsbImageBuilder's
    style — constructor holds verbose, small colored logging helpers, one
    method per step, an enable() entry point) rather than a set of loose
    module-level functions each taking their own dry_run argument.

    Package downloads go through the shared PackageDownloader (see that
    module) — the exact same atomic-download-with-caching mechanism
    NvidiaUsbImageBuilder uses to fetch NVIDIA driver packages. Unlike
    those, though, these are Valve's own SteamOS kernel builds, not
    general Arch packages, so the download URL isn't resolved via
    archlinux.org/pin_pkg() (those packages aren't published there at
    all) — it's resolved from the running system's OWN
    /etc/pacman.conf + /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist, the same jupiter-repo +
    mirror-template approach NvidiaUsbImageBuilder.resolve_headers_url()
    uses against a mounted image's pacman.conf/mirrorlist, just read
    directly off the live filesystem here instead of a chroot. This
    replaces the old (now-removed) file_downloader.py's
    check_mirror_and_download_package(), which hit a single hardcoded
    Valve mirror URL with no atomic write and no local caching.
